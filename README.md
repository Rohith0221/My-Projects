Note that the full source code for these projects is kept private due to academic requirements, but feel free to reach out to me if youâ€™d like access to the code for further review.

List of Projects I have worked on :

Solo :

**Project Name: Simon Game**

_Language Used: C++,
Framework: Qt,
IDE: QtCreator

Overview of the project :

Developed a game similar to SimonGame using Qt Framework and C++ in QtCreator to enhance my GUI development and event-driven programming skills. This game includes core logic for random pattern generation and 
user interaction with buttons along with some cool animation transitions.

Team Projects:

**Project Name: Basic Sprite Editor**

Language Used: C++,
Framework: Qt,
IDE: QtCreator,
Development Model: Agile/Scrum and Kanban

Overview of the project :

Developed a sprite editor using Qt Framework and C++ in QtCreator with a team of 3 other members to enhance my GUI development and event-driven programming skills. This game includes core logic for allowing the user to draw on canvas using different tools and 
providing buttons for user interactions. Contains interesting features such as playing the sprite animations at a certain frame rate, importing images onto Canvas, drawing shapes, etc...

**Project Name: Chinese Language Writing Teaching App**

_Language Used: C++,
Framework: Qt,
Libraries Used: Box2D and several other Qt Libraries,
IDE: QtCreator,
Development Model: Agile/Scrum and Kanban

Overview of the project :

Developed an app using Qt Framework and C++ and Box2D in QtCreator with a team of 3 other members to enhance my GUI development, Box2D physics simulations, and event-driven programming skills. This application teaches users how to write a few Chinese words and characters
with custom combinations giving them real-time translation in English to help them understand what the word is alongside allowing users to trace the word which also has a feedback mechanism that corresponds to how accurately the character is traced.

**Project Name: Spreadsheet Editor**

Language Used: C#,
Frameworks Used: .Net MAUI
Libraries Used: Maui.Graphics,
IDE: Visual Studio,
Development Model: Scrum

Overview of the project:

Developed a robust Spreadsheet program using C# and .NET MAUI, featuring dynamic formula evaluation and validation functionality.

Implemented a custom GraphDependencyLibrary to simulate spreadsheet-like behavior by establishing and managing dependencies between cells, allowing automatic updates when referenced cells change.

Enhanced the formula validation system to support double-precision floating-point evaluation, enabling accurate and flexible numerical computations.

This project demonstrates advanced skills in GUI development, data dependency management, and real-time recalculation similar to professional-grade spreadsheet software.
