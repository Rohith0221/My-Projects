_Language Used: C++
Framework: Qt
IDE: QtCreator_

Overview of the project :

Developed a sprite editor using Qt Framework and C++ in QtCreator with a team of 3 other members to enhance my GUI development and event-driven programming skills. This game includes core logic for allowing the user to draw on canvas using different tools and 
providing buttons for user interactions. Contains interesting features such as playing the sprite animations at a certain frame rate, importing images onto Canvas, drawing shapes, etc...

**Project Name: Chinese Language Writing Teaching App**

_Language Used: C++
Framework: Qt
Libraries Used: Box2D and several other Qt Libraries
IDE: QtCreator_

Overview of the project :

Developed an app using Qt Framework and C++ and Box2D in QtCreator with a team of 3 other members to enhance my GUI development, Box2D physics simulations, and event-driven programming skills. This application teaches users how to write a few Chinese words and characters
with custom combinations giving them real-time translation in English to help them understand what the word is alongside allowing users to trace the word which also has a feedback mechanism that corresponds to how accurately the character is traced.
