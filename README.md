# My-Projects


List of Projects I have worked on :

**Solo:**

# Project Name: Simon Game

Language Used: C++,
Framework: Qt,
IDE: QtCreator

Overview of the project :

Developed a game similar to SimonGame using Qt Framework and C++ in QtCreator to enhance my GUI development and event-driven programming skills. This game includes core logic for random pattern generation and 
user interaction with buttons along with some cool animation transitions.

**Team Projects:**

# Project Name: Basic Sprite Editor

Language Used: C++,
Framework: Qt,
IDE: QtCreator,
Development Model: Agile/Scrum and Kanban

Overview of the project :

Developed a sprite editor using Qt Framework and C++ in QtCreator with a team of 3 other members to enhance my GUI development and event-driven programming skills. This game includes core logic for allowing the user to draw on canvas using different tools and 
providing buttons for user interactions. Contains interesting features such as playing the sprite animations at a certain frame rate, importing images onto Canvas, drawing shapes, etc...

# Project Name: Chinese Language Writing Teaching App

Language Used: C++,
Framework: Qt,
Libraries Used: Box2D and several other Qt Libraries,
IDE: QtCreator,
Development Model: Agile/Scrum and Kanban

Overview of the project :

Developed an app using Qt Framework and C++ and Box2D in QtCreator with a team of 3 other members to enhance my GUI development, Box2D physics simulations, and event-driven programming skills. This application teaches users how to write a few Chinese words and characters
with custom combinations giving them real-time translation in English to help them understand what the word is alongside allowing users to trace the word which also has a feedback mechanism that corresponds to how accurately the character is traced.

# Project Name: Spreadsheet Editor

Language Used: C#,
Frameworks Used: .Net MAUI
Libraries Used: Maui.Graphics,
IDE: Visual Studio,
Development Model: Scrum

Overview of the project:

Developed a robust Spreadsheet program using C# and .NET MAUI, featuring dynamic formula evaluation and validation functionality.

Implemented a custom GraphDependencyLibrary to simulate spreadsheet-like behavior by establishing and managing dependencies between cells, allowing automatic updates when referenced cells change.

Enhanced the formula validation system to support double-precision floating-point evaluation, enabling accurate and flexible numerical computations.

This project demonstrates advanced skills in GUI development, data dependency management, and real-time recalculation similar to professional-grade spreadsheet software.

# Project Name: DrawingApp – Collaborative Mobile Drawing Application

Languages Used: Kotlin, Java
Framework: Android SDK, Ktor (Client and Server)
IDE: Android Studio
Development Model: Agile/Scrum

Overview of the project:

Built an Android mobile application in a team of 4 using Android Studio and the Ktor framework to enable users to draw freely on a canvas with customizable tools. The app supports various pen colors and stroke sizes, an eraser, saving and reopening past drawings, and most notably, the ability to share drawings with others and import shared drawings for continued editing or viewing.

I contributed heavily to the client-side UI, including the design and implementation of most of the screens, the file import feature, and pen customization tool (color picker). Teammates worked on additional features like blur and noise filters and the Ktor-based backend server for sharing functionality.

# Project Name: Grading Web Application(Grader app)

Languages Used: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Framework: Django
Libraries/Tools Used: Django Authentication and Authorization Modules
IDE: Visual Studio Code
Development Model: Solo Project (Independent Development)

Overview of the project:

Developed a full-stack web application using Django to simulate a basic grading system with multi-role user support. This solo project focused on implementing backend logic, authentication workflows, and dynamic rendering of role-specific pages using Django templates.

The application supports three types of users — Students, TAs, and Admin (Superuser) — with distinct permissions and functionality:

    Students can log in, view assignments, and submit work based on assignment due dates. They also see a real-time calculation of their total score on their dashboard.

    TAs and Admins can log in, grade student submissions, assign scores, and create or manage assignment records.

The app leverages Django’s built-in authentication and authorization modules for secure login/logout and role-based access control. The front end was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a clean and responsive user experience.
